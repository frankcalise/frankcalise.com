# Ciao, Frank here!

I'm a software engineer and hobbyist bodybuilder 🏋. I was born, raised and grew up
in Long Island, New York. I spent 4 years in Blacksburg, Virginia where I went 
to [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu) (Go Hokies! 🦃) and graduated with a Bachelor
of Science in Computer Engineering.

I've written code for
[BAE Systems](https://www.basesystems.com/),
[FOUR32C](https://four32c.com/), [Martha Stewart](https://www.marthastewart.com), 
[Ferrandino and Son](https://www.ferrandinoandson.com/), [Intelligent Product Solutions](https://intelligentproduct.solutions/), [PepsiCo](http://www.pepsico.com/), and [Clean Eatz of Beaufort](https://www.cleaneatz.com/location/loc/beaufort).

**I now work remotely full-time for [Vitralogy](https://www.vitralogy.com/).**
I develop and maintain all [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) applications which 
make up the world's only Operations as a Service platform to automate critical
processes to Legionella compliance.

I currently live in Hilton Head, South Carolina ☀️🌴 with my girlfriend Kristie
❤️ and our two pups 🐶.
